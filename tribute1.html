            <div class="coltxt">Bill Gates, sometimes known as William Henry Gates III, is an American computer scientist, philanthropist, and businessman who co-founded Microsoft with Paul Allen. The son of William Henry Gates II and Mary Gates, he was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. He attended Seattle's exclusive Lakeside Elite School, where he first displayed an interest in computer science. He and his friend Paul Allen launched the Microsoft Software Company on April 4, 1975, while they were both undergraduates at Harvard University. He left the institution a year later to relocate to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the home of ITS (Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems), where he agreed to share 50% of the teaching duties.
                Bill Gates made the decision to relocate Microsoft to Seattle in 1979 as the company started to expand. He met with IBM representatives in the early 1980s and was able to convince them to purchase the MS-DOS operating system from him because he did not already own it. To compete with Apple, IBM required that operating system. Tim Paterson, who worked for Seattle Computer Products, eventually sold Microsoft's copyright to QDOS. Bill Gates visited Apple to offer his assistance in improving their spreadsheets and other programs after learning about the significance of the graphics environment they had demonstrated. This helped forge an alliance between Apple and Microsoft. As a direct rival to the Macintosh, Microsoft, led by Bill Gates, legally acquired the technology for graphic and mouse environments and released it on the market for Microsoft Windows.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="coltxt">Bill Gates received the National Medal of Technology from President Bush in 1992 in recognition of his contributions to technology. With the invention of the "mouse" and a new graphical user interface to replace DOS around 1983, Bill Gates once again revolutionized personal computing (Windows). His friend Paul Allen left Microsoft the same year due to health issues. During this time, the company focused on the promotion of multimedia support, especially in the educational field. In addition to the success of a competitive and adaptable business run according to unorthodox principles, Gates' talent was demonstrated in a number of computer programs whose use was widespread throughout the world as the fundamental languages of personal computers. Bill Gates' ongoing inventions started to speed up the spread of new technologies.The ongoing breakthroughs of Bill Gates started to aid in the quick spread of personal computing, resulting in a transcendental technical evolution in the methods of information creation, transmission, and consumption.
              He married Melinda French in 1994 and paid $25 million for a Leonardo da Vinci manuscript. On June 16, 2006, Bill Gates announced his intention to resign as the CEO of Microsoft and devote himself entirely to the foundation. On June 27, 2008, he officially retired and handed the reins of the company over to Steve Ballmer. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation receives 70% of Bill Gates' time, while the corporation receives the remaining 30%.</p>

            <h2>10 Bill Gates Wisdom Quotes Every Business Owner Needs to Hear</h2><br>
            <p>Bill Gates has a lot of wisdom to share about how to build a successful business and how to give back. Here are 10 memorable Bill Gates quotes everyone should read.</p>
             <br>
            <q>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.</q>
            <q>We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve.</q>     
            <q>Patience is a key element of success.</q>            
            <q>The belief that the world is getting worse, that we can’t solve extreme poverty and disease, isn’t just mistaken. It’s harmful.</q>
             <q>Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast, or a bridge player.</q>
             <q>Don't compare yourself with anyone in this world ... if you do so, you are insulting yourself.</q>
             <q>Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.</q>
             <q>I can understand wanting to have millions of dollars, there’s a certain freedom, meaningful freedom, that comes with that. But once you get much beyond that, I have to tell you, it’s the same hamburger.</q>
             <q>Television is not real life. In real life, people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.</q>
             <q>It’s fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.</q>
