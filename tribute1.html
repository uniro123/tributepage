                    <h1>INTRO</h1>
                    <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
                    <p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> was a <strong>German-born Theoretical Physicist</strong>, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential <strong>Physicists of all time</strong>. <strong>Einstein</strong> is best known for developing the <strong>Theory of Relativity</strong>, but he also made important contributions to the development of the <strong>Theory of Quantum Mechanics</strong>. <strong>Relativity</strong> and <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong> are the two pillars of <strong>Modern Physics</strong>. His mass–energy equivalence formula <strong>E = mc2</strong>, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed <strong>"The World's Most Famous Equation"</strong>. His work is also known for its influence on the <strong>Philosophy of Science</strong>. He received the <strong>1921 Nobel Prize in Physics</strong> <strong>"for his services to theoretical physics</strong>, and especially for his discovery of the <strong>Law of the Photoelectric Effect</strong></p>
                    <p class="ein">He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in <strong>"Einstein"</strong> becoming synonymous with <strong>"Genius"</strong>. <strong>Einsteinium</strong>, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.</p>

                     <h1>CAREER</h1>
                     <p>In 1900, Einstein graduated from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich <br>and became a Swiss citizen. He worked briefly as a teacher and then joined <br>the Swiss Patent Office in 1902 as a technical expert. During his time at <br>the patent office, Einstein published several influential papers on <br>theoretical physics, including his groundbreaking work on the photoelectric <br>effect, which earned him a PhD from the University of Zurich in 1905. <br>These papers established him as a leading physicist, and he secured a <br>position as a lecturer and later as a professor at various academic <br>institutions in Europe.</p>
                     <p class="career2">In 1905, often referred to as Einstein's "annus mirabilis" or "miracle year," he published four <br>groundbreaking papers in the scientific journal Annalen der Physik. These papers revolutionized the <br>field of physics and laid the foundation for modern physics. They introduced the concept of special <br>relativity, which included the famous equation E=mc^2 (mass-energy equivalence), and explained the <br>phenomenon of Brownian motion, among other achievements. These contributions earned Einstein <br>international recognition and set the stage for his further research and career advancements.</p>
                      <p class="career3">Einstein continued his research and teaching at various academic institutions, including the <br>University of Zurich, Charles University in Prague, and the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. <br>In 1915, he formulated the general theory of relativity, which expanded on his special theory of relativity <br>and proposed a new understanding of gravity. Einstein's work during this period also included <br>important contributions to quantum theory, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics. He received <br>numerous awards and honors for his contributions to physics, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 <br>for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. In the 1930s, Einstein emigrated to the <br>United States due to the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, and he joined the Institute for Advanced Study <br>in Princeton, New Jersey, where he continued his research and teaching until his death in 1955.</p>

      <h1>PERSONAL LIFE</h1>
      <p>Albert Einstein, the renowned physicist, was born on March 14, 1879, <br>in Ulm, Germany, and died on April 18, 1955, <br>in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. Apart from his immense contributions <br>to the field of physics, Einstein's personal life was also notable in <br>several ways.</p>
       <p class="personal2">Einstein had a complex family life. He was married twice and had <br>three children. His first wife, Mileva Marić, was a fellow physics <br>student whom he married in 1903. They had two sons, Hans Albert and <br>Eduard. However, their marriage faced difficulties, and they <br>eventually divorced in 1919. Einstein later married his cousin, <br>Elsa Löwenthal, in 1919. Elsa had two daughters from her previous <br>marriage, Ilse and Margot, whom Einstein treated as his stepdaughters.</p>
       <p class="personal3">Einstein was known for his pacifist and humanitarian views. He was a vocal advocate for peace, disarmament, <br>and civil rights. He was also politically active and supported Zionism and the establishment of the state <br>of Israel, although he later became critical of some of Israel's policies. He was also an advocate for <br>nuclear disarmament and warned about the potential dangers of atomic weapons.</p>
       <p class="personal4">Einstein faced challenges during his personal life, including being forced to leave Germany in 1933 due to <br>the rise of Nazi anti-Semitism. He moved to the United States, where he accepted a position at the Institute <br>for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and remained there for the rest of his life.</p>
       <p class="personal5">Einstein had various hobbies and interests outside of physics. He was an accomplished violinist <br>and loved playing the violin. He also enjoyed sailing, hiking, and spending time in nature. Additionally, <br>he was known for his wit, sense of humor, and love for philosophy and literature.</p>

    <h1>DEATH</h1>
    <h2>"I want to go when I want to go. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially, <br>&nbsp;I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."<br><br>&nbsp;- Albert Einstein</h2>
      <p>April 18, 1955—Albert Einstein dies soon after a blood vessel bursts near his heart. When asked if he wanted to undergo surgery, Einstein refused. After an autopsy, Einstein's body was cremated and his ashes spread in an undisclosed location.</p>
      <p class="death">The world mourned Einstein's death. At his request, his office and house were not turned into memorials.</p>
