        <h1>ALBERT EINSTEIN</h1>
        <p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> was a <strong>German-born Theoretical Physicist</strong>, widely acknowledged <br>to be one of the greatest and most influential <strong>Physicists of all time</strong>. <br><strong>Einstein</strong> is best known for developing the <strong>Theory of Relativity</strong>, but he <br>also made important contributions to the development of the <br><strong>Theory of Quantum Mechanics</strong>. <strong>Relativity</strong> and <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong> are the <br>two pillars of <strong>Modern Physics</strong>. His massâ€“energy equivalence formula <br><strong>E = mc2</strong>, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed <br><strong>"The World's Most Famous Equation"</strong>. His work is also known for its influence<br>on the <strong>Philosophy of Science</strong>. He received the <strong>1921 Nobel Prize in Physics</strong> <br><strong>"for his services to theoretical physics</strong>, and especially for his discovery <br>of the <strong>Law of the Photoelectric Effect</strong>, a pivotal step in the development <br>of <strong>Quantum Theory</strong>.</p>
        <p class="ein">His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in <strong>"Einstein"</strong> becoming synonymous with <strong>"Genius"</strong>. <br><strong>Einsteinium</strong>, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.</p>
